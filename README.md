# PureJS_onePageNav

The PureJS_onePageNav library is designed to dynamically manage states of navigation links based on scroll offset. It comes with several options that allow customize page navigation working as intended.

Main functionalities:

- update hash accordingly to nav link or section
- choosing which link should be default active if none section reached
- exactly matching sections and no section zones with exact match option
- allows to set classes on links parents like [li, nav], not only anchor tags
- enforcing script loading only if suits defined URL paths
- defining distance from top, at which section should be changed
- visualization line for easier understanding
- changing options after script initialization
